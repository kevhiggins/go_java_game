The game that we have created is an online multiplayer Go.


* To run the program simply open the file named team_project6.jar

* Once the program is running you have several options.

  1. If you don't know how to play Go click on the "Help" menu and then "How to
     play Go."

  2. If you already know how to play you can start a game with a friend.


* Before you can play a game with someone one of you must host a server.

 - To host the server go to File->Connect. Make sure the "Host game" radio button
   is selected, enter a name (optional) and click "OK." You will automatically be
   connected to your own server.

 - If your friend is already hosting a game you can connect to them by also going
   to File->Connect, but this time making sure to select the "Connect to Server"
   radio button.  Next you need to type the IP address of the person who's hosting
   the game in the text box labeled "Host IP Address."  If you want type in a name
   and click "OK."  If the person has started hosting you should be instantly
   connected.

* Now that you have established a connection you can communicate with the other
 person using the text boxes at the bottom of the screen.  You will be identified
 by the name you typed in the Connection window. (If you didn't type one in your
 name is your IP address)

* Once you and an opponent are connected you can go to File->New Game to create a
 new game.  You will be prompted for a game size.  Once you click "OK" your
 opponent will be asked if they wish to play.  If they accept a new game will
 begin.

* At any time during the game you can pass or forfeit by clicking those buttons.

* Once you and your opponent both pass one after another the game will end and
 the scoring process will begin.

* The game is scored by adding up each players controlled territory, and adding
 the amount of pieces they captured to that amount. Black gets also gets a 6.5
 point penalty due to the imabalancing nature of going first. In order to get to
 the point where all the territory is discovered, the players click pieces that
 they believe to be dead in territory. When they do so, they are counted as captures
 to the opposing player, and once all the opposing pieces that are occupying friendly
 territory are removed, it is counted as territory gained.


* After the scoring is complete you can start another game, disconnect, or exit.
